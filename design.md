# Design Notes

Scratchpad for while I'm working

## Blog Posts

The list of blog posts must be dynamic.
We will want to filter by tag: C, Python, etc.
The home page must display all posts (allowing for pagination).

Long-term, posts will come from a database?
Short-term, put the posts in Python.
We need:
    post name/URL
    short text/intro
