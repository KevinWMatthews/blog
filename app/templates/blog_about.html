			<h1>What is this blog all about?</h1>
			<p>This series of posts is about good practices in software development.</p>
			<p>The examples are built around design patterns, testing strategies, language
				semantics, and third-party libraries. It is a collection of what I've
				had occasion to learn, so there is a bias toward embedded systems.</p>
			<p>The goal of each post is to actually do the thing in question, so
				code examples are part of working projects. These are available on GitHub.</p>
