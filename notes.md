# Things I've Learned

Random collection of stuff that I didn't used to know.

## Overflow wrap

Prevent text from leaving the div:

```
class="overflow-wrap"
```

Then in css:
```
overflow-wrap: normal;
overflow-wrap: break-word;
```

See [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-wrap)


## Loading javascript

Blocking, async, or defer?
